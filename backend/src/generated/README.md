# Generated Files Directory

This directory contains auto-generated code that should not be manually edited.

## Prisma Client

The Prisma Client is generated here when running:

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
```

The client code is generated based on your schema definition in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

## Why This Directory?

- **IDE Integration**: Having generated files in the source directory improves IDE integration for type checking and auto-completion
- **Version Control**: The actual generated files are gitignored, but the directory structure is preserved
- **Imports**: Makes import paths cleaner and more consistent

## Do Not:

- Manually edit any files in the generated subdirectories
- Commit generated files to version control
