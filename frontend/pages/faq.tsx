        {
          question: "How does the AI learn my communication style?",
          answer: "Our AI analyzes your past emails and messages to understand your tone, vocabulary, and response patterns. Over time, it adapts to match your unique communication style. The more you use YourManager, the more personalized it becomes."

          question: "Can YourManager reply to emails automatically?",

        {
          question: "How does the calendar optimization work?",
